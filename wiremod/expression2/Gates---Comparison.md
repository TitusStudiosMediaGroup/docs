As the title suggests these gates perform a comparison between two values then output either a 1 or a 0
depending on the result of the comparison.

    Is In Range (exclusive)  
    Is In Range (inclusive)  

**Equal**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  A B  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Outputs 1 when A and B are the same, else outputs 0.  

**Not Equal**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  A B  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Outputs 1 when A and B are not the same, else outputs 0.  

**Greater Than**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  A B  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Outputs 1 when A is greater than B, else outputs 0.  

**Greater Than or Equal**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  A B  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Outputs 1 when A is equal or greater than B, else outputs 0.  

**Less Than**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  A B  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Outputs 1 when A is less than B, else outputs 0.  

**Less Than or Equal**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  A B  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Outputs 1 when A is equal or less than B, else outputs 0.  

**Is In Range (Exclusive)**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  Value Min Max  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Acts as a combined greater and less than gate  
Outputs 1 when Value is greater than Min and less than Max  

**Is In Range (inclusive)**  
Inputs: 	Type-Number  Value Min Max  
Outputs: 	Type-Number  Out  
Description: 	Acts as a combined greater than or equal and less than or equal gate  
Outputs 1 when Value is greater than or equal to Min and less than or equal to Max
